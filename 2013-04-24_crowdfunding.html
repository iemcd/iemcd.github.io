	<h1>An Analysis of Crowdfunding Data</h1>
	<p>
  A paper submitted for Advanced Control Strategies with Dr. Seongkyu Yoon, 24 April 2013.
  </p>
  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>
  The development and implementation of crowdfunding as an institution is reviewed, and a large data set from one of the largest crowdfunding platforms, Kickstarter, is examined using both principal component analysis (PCA) and a projection to latent structures (PLS). From this analysis it becomes apparent that projects may be divided into “failed” “successful” and “wildly successful”, and that while a variety of factors correspond to project success or failure, wild successes are only indicated reliably by the number of comments on the project. A tendency for Kickstarter to produce a consumerist mindset is proposed to explain this, despite a conscious effort on their part to discourage that.
